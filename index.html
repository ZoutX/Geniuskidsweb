                                <b>Our curriculum</b> is based on Te Whāriki Early Childhood curriculum and inspired by the Reggio Emilia Approach to childcare that puts children at the center of their learning in relationship-driven environments.<br /><br />The aim of our teaching methods, creative spaces and compassionate teaching is to nurture each child’s innate competence, curiosity and imagination, enabling them to contribute to their own learning and wellbeing. This is done through many languages of expression and communication.<br /><br />Our teachers carefully listen, observe, and document the work of each child, encouraging them to develop their thinking and learning. They also reflect on their own teaching, learning, and work by sharing ideas and observations within the instructorial team, whanau and with the tamariki themselves.<br /><br />
                                It is important to us that we instill in each child a sense of confidence, self-awareness and belief that that are unique and can do anything!

                                Aroha and manaakitanga are at the centre of our infant care and education. It is a beautiful journey that develops trusting relationships with respect, creativity and care.<br /><br />We understand and articulate the abilities and individual needs of each infant through our thoughtful, loving and caring relationships with them.<br /><br />The Reggio Emilia Approach is introduced in these early stages of care; philosophies that develop a sense of self, learning and relationship within a social environment.<br /><br />At Genius Kids Early Childhood Educational Center, infants acquire knowledge by exploring their environment as well as experimenting and interacting with sensible and thoughtful materials.<br /><br />These mediums and materials include but are not limited to classical music, creative art, storytelling and drama - all of which are incorporated into our infant routine and rituals.</p>

                            Each child is capable, unique and competent. Whanaungatanga and partnership between children, teachers and parents are the heart of our teaching and learning practices. We aspire to offer a culture of creative spaces where every child, like pikopiko, unfolds their language of learning.<br /><br />

                            This philosophy is also guided by the Ministry of Early Childhood Regulations 2008.
